# Want to know if you are a PÃ©pite?
# Welcome to The Pepite Game

 You are given 12 coins, 1 one which are fake, but you don't know if the fake coin is heavier or lighter.
 You are also given a regular balance with two plates.

## The game is simple: Elaborate a strategy to determine which one of the 12 coins is fake, and if it is lighter or heavier.
 Beware, as you can use this balance 3 times at most. If you try to use it more than 3 times, the game ends.

 To use this balance, simply call
 `Measure.new(left_side_coins, right_side_coins).measure`
 with your `left_side_coins` and `right_side_coins` (arrays of coins, sub-arrays of the coins input).

 The result will be one of the following: `:left`, `:right`, or `:middle`
   - `:left` if the left side is heavier than the right side
   - `:right` if the right side is heavier than the left side
   - `:middle` if the left side and the right side of the balance are

## Your goal is to write the `perform` method in `my_strategy.rb`
 When you are done, run `ruby am_i__a_pepite.rb` in your terminal to see the result of your efforts.
 Good luck, and remember:
   - Do not ever use the balance more than 3 times, or chaos will ensue
   - Take a pick at the 'secret' directory and you'll be burnt to ashes in a glimpse. I wouldn't do that if I were you

 For additional points, document your code, and explain why your strategy is better than everybody else's.
## Have fun.
